We\u2019ve tried many different brands off Amazon but this one seems to hold the fizz in for little over a week. The fit is great for any soda can and is leak proof.

In cans it tastes better and has better carbonation.Unfortunately, they are not great to take on the go, whether traveling or just running errands. They spill easy, and I'm always paranoid about germs and insects getting in it. I've gone tk take a drink and been stung by bees and yellow jackets in my mouth!!My husband teased me because I always used to put a plastic baggie over the top of my can, or twist up a paper towel and stick it in the hole!Not anymore! I found these!! They are so inexpensive - but the quality is GREAT!The lid screws on tightly, and fits well enough to avoid drops or spills. But, yet not so tight that it hurts my carpal tunnel and arthritis to open.The colors are great and they are super easy to wash! I'm about to buy several more because the rest of my family loves them, too, and are always swiping mine!These are a MUST BUY!","purchase_model":"Size: 3 Pack Color: Black/White/Camouflage Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-10-14 16:07:03"},{"user":"Peanut","content":"Love these things. I usually take a can Coke outside with me during the day and these covers keep any flies, mosquitos ( I live in Fl., we have lots of both ) from crawling on top of the can. Especially diving in and sneaking a drink. They fit tightly. I have knocked the cans over couple of times, one time nothing came out and one time just a drop or two came out. I recommend them highly. Their very easy to put on and take off..and no more swatting the top of the can..","purchase_model":"Size: 3 Pack Color: Black/White/Camouflage Green  Reviews","score":"5.0","date":"2024-07-19 16:07:03"},{"user":"Jamie","content":"The price is way too good for these. I love the way they fit on the different cans I drink from. I dropped one and not a drop escaped! I bought these because my dog likes to jump from seat to seat in the car and I don\u2019t want his fur in my drinks. I often have my hands full when leaving and coming home so these make it super easy to travel with. They stretch. They are easy to remove and put on.

So I opened up two cans at the same time - and covered one as soon as I was finished eating and put them both back in the fridge (one opened and one covered) I went to drink it about 5-6 hours later and it was about 90% fizzy. Trust me that is good. The other/open can was gross and flat.I have tried other styles (like the ones that have a push down) but you can tell this one works well, you hear the air \"pop\" when you take it off to drink - I think its because it is a simple yet efficient design - no gaps, no holes, fits perfectly.I did try it over night (so about 12 hours) and the fizzy was down to about 40-50% which is still better than nothing but I think it is more of a day use tool.I am actually really impressed that I opened up Amazon after I just finished my dinner and had to review. For the price don't even think twice - just get it (wash them before hand in hot water)Also there was no \"rubber\" smell that I have noticed. It feels like siliconeI used it on a normal sized can - haven't tried it on the small thin cans yetSuper happy!
